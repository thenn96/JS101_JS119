A function that returns the sum of two numbers. 

START

SET sum = number1 + number 2 

Print sum 

END 


a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START 

#Given an array to join together as a string. 

Return array as a string using array.join

END

a method that takes an array of integers, 
and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element.
 For instance: everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]); // => [1,7,5]

START

#Given array to form another array with every other number of that array 

SET everyOther = []
SET iterator = 0

WHILE Iterator <= length of given array 
	SET array space into everyOther with .push 
	SET iterator to increase by 2 

RETURN everyOther array

a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. 
For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x').
 If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

START 

SET Function to ask for the sting and character (char) you are looking for 
SET count = 0 
SET i = 0

WHile i < char.length
	IF char === current letter
		count = count +1
	IF count > 3 
	PRINT i
	ELSE 
	PRINT null

END

#a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. 
The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, 
while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.

START

SET funtion to take two array: arrayOne arrayTwo

SET mergedArray = []
SET inicatorOne = 0
SET indicatorTwo = 1

WHILE indicatorOne < arrayOne.length 
	mergedArray[inidicaterOne] = arrayOne[indicatorONE]
	indicatorONE = indicatorOne + 2
	

WHILE indicatorTwo < arrayTwo.length
	mergedArray[indicatorTwo] = arrayTwo[indicatorTwo]
	indicatorTwo = indicatoeTwo + 2

PRINT mergedARRAY 

END
